The shop was originally located in Afflecks Palace and has recently moved to its present location on Stevenson Square (5a Stevenson Sq, Northern Quarter, Manchester, M1 1DN) in 2011. It soon became a cultural icon and integral part within the Manchester music scene. Back in the late 80&amp;#146;s E Bloc helped to launch bands such as the Inspiral Carpets, while also hosting in-store signings with The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. The shop was also responsible for breaking much of the new dance music at the time, being one of the only shops in the UK to import dance music from around the globe. One of the owners went on to become part of 808 State. E Bloc also had heavy involvement in the early career paths of A Guy Called Gerald &amp; K Klass. Many famous faces have worked behind the counter or been regular customers in the shop. Local DJ&amp;#146;s and globe trotting club DJ&amp;#146;s would use E Bloc as their first port of call to get their hands on the latest vinyl promos. Customers include Laurent Garnier, Jon Da Silva, Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, Sasha, Chemical Brothers, DJ Marky, Anthony Shake Shakir, Pepe Bradock, Eric Morillo, Josh Wink, Ben Sims, James Holroyd, Derrick Carter, Carl Cox, Synkro, Indigo, AnD, XXXY, Jon K, Rich Reason and many more. Previous members of staff include Justin Robertson, Marcus Intalex, Mark XTC, Moonboots, Dean Wilson, Paul Walker, Paul Taylor, Karl Roscoe, Chris Fatboy, AnD. <br> <br> E Bloc has always been at the cutting edge of the music scene as is arguably one of the most respected, renowned, influential and notorious in the world. Today, the store is still shifting vinyl and cd&amp;#146;s, specialising mainly in drum &amp; bass, jungle, dubstep, house, techno, jazz, world, reggae and electronica<br> <br> We recently have been refurbished and are now also a music venue with a new sound system and a fully licensed bar stocking wines, cocktails, beers, spirits &amp; craft ales.
